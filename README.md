# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Your Task

The assignment was to modify starter code so that I can create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write, save and delete notes. The Note Taker application will use an Express.js back end and will save, retrieve and delete note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end was already created. It was my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write, save notes and delete them.
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
